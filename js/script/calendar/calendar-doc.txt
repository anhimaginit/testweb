Description: This type of value is a structured value that includes a list of one or more grammatical repeats. 
Each rule section is identified by the pair NAME = VALUE. The rule sections are separated by the SEMICOLON character. 
The rules sections are not arranged in any particular sequence. Individual rule sections MUST be specified only once. 
Compliant applications MUST accept the rules sections arranged in any sequence, but to ensure backward compatibility with 
iCalWiki's pre-revised applications, the FREQ rule section MUST be part of The first rule is specified in the RECUR value.

The FREQ rule section defines the type of repetition rule. This rule part MUST be specified in the repeat rule. 
Valid values ​​include 
SECONDLY, to specify recurring events based on a period of one second or more; 
MINUTES, to specify recurring events based on a period of one minute or more; 
HOUR, to specify recurring events based on an hour or more; 
DAILY, to specify recurring events based on one day or more; 
WEEKLY, to specify recurring events based on a period of one week or more; 
MONTHLY, to specify recurring events based on a period of one month or more; 
and YEAR, to specify recurring events based on a period of one year or more.

The INTERVAL rule section contains a positive integer denoting the repetitive rules. 
The default value is "1", meaning 
every second for the SEC rule, 
every minute for the MINUTELY rule, 
every hour for the HOUR rule, 
every day for the DAILY rule, 
every week for the WEEKLY rule, 
every month for MONTHLY rules 
and every year for a YEAR rule. 
For example, in the DAILY rule, the value "8" means that every eight days.

The UNTIL rule section defines a value of DATE or DATE-TIME that limits the rule to repeat in an inclusive manner. 
If the value specified by UNTIL is synchronized with the specified repetition, DATE or DATE-TIME will become the last case of recurrence. 
The value of the UNTIL rule part MUST have the same value type as the attribute "DTSTART". 
Furthermore, if the attribute "DTSTART" is specified as a date in local time, the UNTIL rule part MUST also be specified as a date with local time. 
If the attribute "DTSTART" is specified as a UTC date or a date with a local time zone and time zone reference, 
the UNTIL rule section MUST be specified as a UTC date. In the case of the "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components, 
the UNTIL rule part MUST always be designated as a UTC date. 
If specified as the value DATE-TIME, it MUST be specified in UTC time format. 
If not present and the COUNT rule section is not present, "RRULE" is considered to be repeated forever.

The rule part COUNT defines the number of occurrences to limit the scope of repetition. 
Property value "DTSTART" is always counted as the first occurrence.

The BYSECOND rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of seconds within a minute. Valid values ​​are 0 to 60. 
The BYMINUTE rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of minutes within an hour. Valid values ​​are 0 to 59. 
The BYHOUR rule part specifies a COMMA- separated list of hours of the day. Valid values ​​are 0 to 23. 
The BYSECOND, BYMINUTE and BYHOUR rule parts MUST NOT be specified when the associated "DTSTART" property has a DATE value type. 
These rule parts MUST be ignored in RECUR value that violate the above requirement 
(e.g., generated by applications that pre-date this revision of iCalendar).
    The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the week; 
    SU indicates Sunday; 
    MO indicates Monday; 
    TU indicates Tuesday;
    WE indicate Wednesday; 
    TH indicates Thursday; 
    FR indicates Friday; 
    and SA indicates Saturday.

    Each BYDAY value can also be preceded by a positive (+ n) or negative (-n) integer. 
If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of a specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY "RRULE".

For example, within a MONTHLY rule, + 1MO (or simply 1MO) epresents the first Monday within the month, 
specifically -1MO represents the last Monday of the month. 
The numeric value in a BYDAY rule part with the FREQ rule part set to YEARLY corresponds to an offset within the month 
when the BYMONTH rule part is present, and corresponds to an offset within the year when the BYWEEKNO or BYMONTH rule parts are present. 
If an integer modifier is not present, it means all days of this type within the specified frequency. 
For example, within a MONTHLY rule, MO represents all Mondays within the month. 
The BYDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified with a numeric value when the FREQ rule part is not set to MONTHLY or YEARLY. 
Furthermore, the BYDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified with a numeric value with the FREQ rule part set to YEARLY when the BYWEEKNO rule part is specified.

    The BYMONTHDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the month. 
Valid values ​​are 1 to 31 or -31 to -1. For example, -10 represents the tenth to the last day of the month. The BYMONTHDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified when the FREQ rule part is set to WEEKLY.

    The BYYEARDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the year. Valid values ​​are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1. For example, -1 representing the last day of the year (December 31st) and -306 representing the 306th to the last day of the year (March 1st). The BYYEARDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified when the FREQ rule part is set to DAILY, WEEKLY, or MONTHLY.

    The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of ordinals specifying weeks of the year. Valid values ​​are 1 to 53 or -53 to -1. This corresponds to weeks according to week numbering as defined in [ISO.8601.2004]. A week is defined as a seven day period, starting on the day of the week defined to be the week start (see WKST). Week number one of the calendar year is the first week that contains at least four (4) days in that calendar year. This rule part MUST NOT be used when the FREQ rule part is set to anything other than YEARLY. For example, 3 represents the third week of the year.

Note: Assuming a Monday week start, week 53 can only occur when Thursday is January 1 or if it is a leap year and Wednesday is January 1.

      The BYMONTH rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of months of the year. Valid values ​​are 1 to 12.

      The WKST rule part specifies the day on which the workweek starts.
      Valid values ​​are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, and SU. This is significant when a WEEKLY "RRULE" has an interval greater than 1, and a BYDAY rule part is specified. This is also significant when in a YEARLY "RRULE" when a BYWEEKNO rule part is specified. The default value is MO.

      The BYSETPOS rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of values ​​that corresponds to the nth occurrence within the set of recurrence instances specified by the rule. BYSETPOS operates on a set of recurrence instances in one interval of the recurrence rule. For example, in a WEEKLY rule, the interval would be one week A set of recurrence instances starts at the beginning of the interval defined by the FREQ rule part. Valid values ​​are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1. It MUST only be used in conjunction with another BYxxx rule part. For example "the last work day of the month" could be represented as:

       FREQ = MONTHLY; BYDAY = MO, TU, WE, TH, FR; BYSETPOS = -1

      Each BYSETPOS value can include a positive (+ n) or negative (-n) integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the specific occurrence within the set of occurrences specified by the rule.

      Recurrence rules may generate recurrence instances with an invalid date (e.g., February 30) or nonexistent local time (e.g., 1:30 AM on a day where the local time is moved forward by an hour at 1:00 AM). Such recurrence instances MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be counted as part of the recurrence set.

      Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the various recurrence instance start time and dates are derived from the Start Time ("DTSTART") component attribute. For example, "FREQ = YEARLY; ​​BYMONTH = 1" doesn't specify a specific day within the month or a time. This information would be the same as what is specified for "DTSTART".

      BYxxx rule parts modify the recurrence in some manner. BYxxx rule parts for a period of time that is the same or greater than the frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of the recurrence generated. For example, "FREQ = DAILY; BYMONTH = 1" reduces the number of recurrence instances from all days (if BYMONTH rule part is not present) to all days in January. BYxxx
      rule parts for a period of time less than the frequency generally increase or expand the number of occurrences of the recurrence.
      For example, "FREQ = YEARLY; ​​BYMONTH = 1.2" increases the number of days within the yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH rule part is not present) to 2.
If multiple BYxxx rule parts are specified, then after evaluating the specified FREQ and INTERVAL rule parts, the BYxxx rule parts are applied to the current set of evaluated occurrences in the following order: BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, BYHOUR, BYMINUTE , BYSECOND and BYSETPOS; then COUNT and UNTIL are evaluated.

      The table below summarizes the dependency of BYxxx rule part expand or limit behavior on the FREQ rule part value.

      The term "N / A" means that the corresponding BYxxx rule part MUST NOT be used with the corresponding FREQ value.

      BYDAY has some special behavior depending on the FREQ value and this is described in separate notes below the table
